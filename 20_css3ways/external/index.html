        The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.
        Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman,
        in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another,
        carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended,
        either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of
        the contending classes. In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a
        complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social
        rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages,
        feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes,
        again, subordinate gradations. The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of
        feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes,
        new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch,
        the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature:
        it has simplified the class antagonisms.
